# Security Policy

## Bug bounty
Unfortunately, ModularWarfare doesn't offer a paid bug bounty programme. GDS will make efforts to show appreciation to people who take the time and effort to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it.

Send details to [contact@arking.fr], including:
- the website, page or repository where the vulnerability can be observed
- a brief description of the vulnerability 
- optionally the type of vulnerability and any related [OWASP category]
- non-destructive exploitation details
